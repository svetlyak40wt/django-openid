Caution: Work in Progress
=========================

The django_openid/ directory contains a brand new version of the django_openid
library, rewritten from the ground up to use newforms-admin style class based
generic views. It is NOT READY yet - it is under active development, with the 
aim to have a fully documented release by the end of Wednesday 27th August.
